::    A "forward flow" message, which is like a request, is passed to
::    Ames from a local vane.  Ames transmits the message to the peer's
::    Ames, which passes the message to the destination vane.
::
::    Once the peer has processed the "forward flow" message, it sends a
::    message acknowledgment over the wire back to the local Ames.  This
::    ack can either be positive or negative, in which case we call it a
::    "nack".  (Don't confuse Ames nacks with TCP nacks, which are a
::    different concept).
::
::    When the local Ames receives either a positive message ack or a
::    combination of a nack and nack-trace (explained in more detail
::    below), it gives an %done move to the local vane that had
::    requested the original "forward flow" message be sent.
::
::    A "backward flow" message, which is similar to a response or a
::    subscription update, is given to Ames from a local vane.  Ames
::    transmits the message to the peer's Ames, which gives the message
::    to the destination vane.
::
::    Ames will give a %memo to a vane upon hearing the message from a
::    remote. This message is a "backward flow" message, forming one of
::    potentially many responses to a "forward flow" message that a
::    local vane had passed to our local Ames, and which local Ames had
::    relayed to the remote.  Ames gives the %memo on the same duct the
::    local vane had originally used to pass Ames the "forward flow"
::    message.
::
::    Backward flow messages are acked automatically by the receiver.
::    They cannot be nacked, and Ames only uses the ack internally,
::    without notifying the client vane.
::
::    Forward flow messages can be nacked, in which case the peer will
::    send both a message-nack packet and a nack-trace message, which is
::    sent on a special diagnostic flow so as not to interfere with
::    normal operation.  The nack-trace is sent as a full Ames message,
::    instead of just a packet, because the contained error information
::    can be arbitrarily large.
::
::    Once the local Ames has received the nack-trace, it knows the peer
::    has received the full message and failed to process it.  This
::    means if we later hear an ack packet on the failed message, we can
::    ignore it.
::
::    Also, due to Ames's exactly-once delivery semantics, we know that
::    when we receive a nack-trace for message n, we know the peer has
::    positively acked all messages m+1 through n-1, where m is the last
::    message for which we heard a nack-trace.  If we haven't heard acks
::    on all those messages, we apply positive acks when we hear the
::    nack-trace.
